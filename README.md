# Patient Management System ‚Äì Microservices Architecture

This project is a **proof-of-work demo** showcasing the technologies I work with in my professional career (***at Acara Systems***).  

The purpose is to **demonstrate practical experience** with building microservices, integrating communication protocols (REST, gRPC, Kafka), implementing authentication and testing strategies, and deploying services with Docker and AWS Infrastructure as Code. 

It demonstrates how to design and deploy scalable, secure, and event-driven systems.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This is a **personal demo project** created solely for portfolio purposes.  
> It is inspired by real-world systems but contains **original code** and **no proprietary or confidential information** from any past or current employer.

## üöÄ Introduction
This repository contains a **full-stack microservices project** that simulates a patient management workflow.  
It covers REST APIs, gRPC communication, Kafka event streaming, authentication with JWT, integration testing, and deployment to AWS (via LocalStack & CloudFormation).

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The system consists of the following services:

- **Patient Service** ‚Äì Core service for managing patients (CRUD operations).
- **Billing Service** ‚Äì gRPC-based service for handling billing logic.
- **Analytics Service** ‚Äì Consumes Kafka patient events for analytics.
- **Auth Service** ‚Äì JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **API Gateway** ‚Äì Single entry point with request routing, filtering, and token validation.

All services are containerized with **Docker**, orchestrated with **ECS**, and integrated with **MSK (Kafka)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, gRPC
- **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL, JPA/Hibernate, In-Memory DB (for testing)
- **Event Streaming:** Apache Kafka (MSK on AWS)
- **Authentication:** Spring Security, JWT
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS LocalStack, CloudFormation, ECS, VPC
- **Testing:** JUnit, Integration Testing
- **CI/CD Ready:** Dockerized builds and IaC deployment scripts

   - REST APIs for patient management
   - gRPC client to Billing Service
   - Kafka producer for patient events

2. **Billing Service**
   - gRPC server handling billing requests

3. **Analytics Service**
   - Kafka consumer for patient events
   - Generates insights

4. **Auth Service**
   - User management
   - JWT authentication and validation

5. **API Gateway**
