# Patient Management System ‚Äì Microservices Architecture

This project is a **production-grade microservices system** built step by step with **Spring Boot, gRPC, Kafka, Docker, API Gateway, Authentication, Testing, and AWS CloudFormation (IaC)**.  
It demonstrates how to design and deploy scalable, secure, and event-driven systems.

## üöÄ Introduction
This repository contains a **full-stack microservices project** that simulates a patient management workflow.  
It covers REST APIs, gRPC communication, Kafka event streaming, authentication with JWT, integration testing, and deployment to AWS (via LocalStack & CloudFormation).

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The system consists of the following services:

- **Patient Service** ‚Äì Core service for managing patients (CRUD operations).
- **Billing Service** ‚Äì gRPC-based service for handling billing logic.
- **Analytics Service** ‚Äì Consumes Kafka patient events for analytics.
- **Auth Service** ‚Äì JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **API Gateway** ‚Äì Single entry point with request routing, filtering, and token validation.

All services are containerized with **Docker**, orchestrated with **ECS**, and integrated with **MSK (Kafka)**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, gRPC
- **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL, JPA/Hibernate, In-Memory DB (for testing)
- **Event Streaming:** Apache Kafka (MSK on AWS)
- **Authentication:** Spring Security, JWT
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS LocalStack, CloudFormation, ECS, VPC
- **Testing:** JUnit, Integration Testing
- **CI/CD Ready:** Dockerized builds and IaC deployment scripts
